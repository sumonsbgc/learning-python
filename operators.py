** "=>" exponentiation

==============================
Python Assignment Operators:
==============================
//= "=>"	x //= 3 "=>" x = x//3 (set the value in variable after floor division)
**= "=>" x **= 3 "=>" x = x**3 (set the value in the variable after exponentiation)
>>= "=>" x >>= 3 "=>" x= x>>3
<<= "=>" x <<= 3 "=>" x= x<<3
:= "=>" print(x:=5) "=>" x=5; print(x) (declare the variable and call the variable)

==============================
Python Identity Operators:
==============================
is "=>" x is y "=>" Returns True if both variables are the same object
is not "=>" x is not y "=>" Returns True if both variables are not the same object

==============================
Python Membership Operators:
==============================
in "=>" x in y "=>" Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
not in "=>" x not in y "=>" Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object

==============================
Python Logical Operators:
==============================
and: 
or: 
not: 

==============================
Python Bitwise Operators: Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
==============================
& => bitwise AND => Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1	(1 & 1 = 1)

| => bitwise OR => Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1	(1 | 0 = 1)

^ => bitwise XOR => Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1

~ => bitwise NOT => Inverts all the bits	

<< => Zero fill left shift
>> => Signed right shift
